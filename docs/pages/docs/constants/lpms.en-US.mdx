# Livepeer Media Server Providers

Chain and network information for use with hooks, connectors, and anywhere else you need in your app.

## lpms

Object containing lpms by name. Useful for creating lists of specific providers, like `defaultLpms`.

```ts
import { lpms } from 'livepeer';

const defaultLpms = [lpms.studio];
```

You can also import individual lpms from the tree shakeable `livepeer/lpms` entrypoint:

```ts
import { studio } from 'livepeer/lpms';
```

## Default Lists

livepeer has built-in LPMS groups for convenience:

```ts
import {
  allLPMS,
  defaultLPMS, // defaults to studio
} from 'livepeer';
```
